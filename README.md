## 📖 Introduction
This project predicts stock market movements by fusing numerical price data (LSTM) with financial news sentiment (NLP). We compare a baseline model against a hybrid fusion architecture to quantify the value of NLP in finance.

**Project Composition:** 60% Machine Learning (LSTM, Fusion, SHAP) + 40% NLP (VADER, NER, TF-IDF, FinBERT)
